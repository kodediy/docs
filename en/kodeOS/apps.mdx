# Applications of the kode dot
Open source communities are based on **sharing knowledge and resources.** That's why the main feature of the kode dot is that your **codes become applications** so you can **share them with other people and show your work.**

In addition, you can also **use applications created by other people and experiment with them.** 

## How it works
If **no code is uploaded to the flash**, you will see the following screen:
<Frame>
  <img width="200"  src="/images/kodeOS/apps/noapp.png" />
</Frame>

When you program the code of your project in your favorite IDE, you can **upload it to your kode dot** as you do on any other platform.

Once uploaded, on the screen of your kode dot you will see two options, **run the code directly or transform the code into an application and save it on your kode dot.**

  <img width="200"  src="/images/kodeOS/apps/app.png" />
</Frame>

### Run
Depending on whether the **maker mode is activated or not**, the code you upload will run automatically or not.

If the maker mode is activated, you will see a **pop-up with a countdown of 3 seconds until the code runs.** You can **cancel the countdown and cancel the execution.**

If the maker mode is deactivated, the code **will not run automatically** and you can run it whenever you want by pressing the run button.

### Create an application
When you have the code validated and working, you can press the **create application** button. You can choose **if you want to change the name and select in which category you want to save it.**

## Application menu
By entering the **application menu, you will see all the available categories.** Although you can create your own categories, by default there are these:

- General
- Hacking
- GPIO
- USB
- Games

</Frame>

In each of them, you will see that there are already applications uploaded so you can **test them.**

## Add applications from other people
All **applications** of your kode dot are **stored on the microSD.** That's why, to add applications from other people, connect the **microSD to your computer** and copy the applications in the **category folder you want.**

<Info>In the future, you will be able to share applications between kode dots wirelessly or download them directly from the store.</Info>
