**Module:** Basic <Icon icon="seedling" iconType="solid" />

# Features
With this module you can connect **motors to your kode dot and make robots like a car following lines.** 

You can connect the following:

- 2x DC motors or 1x stepper motor
- 1x servo motor
- 4x GPIOs for sensors
- 1x I2C bus

It is not necessary to use an external power supply because **everything is powered from the kode dot.**

The **DC motors have to be 5V and are limited by hardware to a current of 700mA per motor.** So, as the kode dot can supply up to 2A, there are **600mA left to connect a servo motor.**

The **DC motors are controlled by PWM** and you can measure the current that each motor is consuming to have an estimation of its torque.

## Connection scheme
The driver that controls the motors is connected as follows:

| Driver  | ESP32-S3 |
| ------- | -------- |
| AIN1    | GPIO42   |
| AIN2    | GPIO41   |
| BIN1    | GPIO40   |
| BIN2    | GPIO39   |
| nFAULT  | GPIO38   |
| AIPROPI | GPIO37   |
| BIPROPI | GPIO36   |

<Tip> AIPROPI and BIPROPI are used to measure the current that each motor is consuming. For more information, consult the driver's datasheet.</Tip>

## Example code
Connect **two DC motors to the connectors** and with this code you will see how they first accelerate, then maintain the maximum speed and finally decelerate.
