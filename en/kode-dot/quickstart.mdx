# What is the kode dot

The kode dot is the **best maker device on the market.** It is a **all-in-one, pocket-sized device with AI capabilities,** that allows you to learn to program electronics and embedded systems while **building and making your ideas a reality.**

It integrates the most advanced hardware and combines it with kodeOS, our open-source operating system, that allows you to **save your code in applications and share them with the community.**

The main technical features of the kode dot are:

| Feature    | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Microcontroller  | **ESP32-S3** - 32MB of flash and 8 MB of PSRAM |
| Screen           | AMOLED 2.13" |
| Led              | RGB Directional |
| Buttons          | 4 buttons pad + 2 buttons |
| Audio            | **Microphone and speaker** |
| Storage          | microSD |
| IMU              | **IMU** of 6 axes + **magnetometer** of 3 axes |
| Connectivity     | WiFi - Bluetooth - ESP-NOW - **2.4GHz** |
| Connectors       | **USB-C** - **Top 20 pins** - **Back magnetic** |

# What's in the box

When you buy the kode dot, you will receive:

- 1x **kode dot**
- 1x **charging and programming cable**
- 3x **stickers**
- 1x **quick start manual**

# How to turn on the kode dot

Just take the kode dot out of the box, **press the button on the bottom right for 2 seconds to turn it on.**

You don't have to worry about turning it off because it will automatically detect when you're not using it and enter **suspend mode.**

<Warning>If you're not going to use your kode dot for a **long period of time**, you can press the button on the bottom right for **5 seconds** to turn it off completely.</Warning>

# Launch your first application

Follow these steps to launch your first application:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter the applications menu">
    Slide your finger **to the left** to enter the **applications menu.** Here, all the categories in which the applications are grouped will appear. Slide down and select the section of **"Games"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the application">
    Here you will see all the applications in the section of "Games". Select the **application "Snake"** to launch it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Application information">
    On this screen you will see the **title of the application and a small description.** Confirm that you want to launch the application by pressing **"YES".**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enjoy the game">
    Your **kode dot will restart** and you can **start playing the famous Snake.**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>To exit the application, press the button on the bottom right at the same time as the left pad.</Tip>

# Create your first application

Submitting your code and converting it into an application is very simple, let's take an example of how to do it with Arduino IDE:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the kode dot">
    In the menu of **Arduino IDE**, select *Tools > Board > kode > kode dot*.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hello world!">
    Open the example of **"Hello World"** in Arduino IDE in *File > Examples > kode > Hello World*.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your kode dot and upload the code">
    Slide your finger **to the right** on the kode dot to enter the **upload code menu.** When you connect your kode dot to the computer, it will appear in the **device list** in the Arduino IDE and by pressing the **"Upload"** button it will upload the code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the application">
    Now in the **upload code menu of the kode dot**, you will see the option to **execute the code you just uploaded or create an application.** Select the option of **"Create App"** and save it in the category of **"General"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the application">
    Go to the applications menu, enter the category of **"General"** and you will see your **newly created application** ready to be launched.
  </Step>
</Steps>
