# Features

The **ESP32-S3** is one of the best microcontrollers of **Espressif** that incorporates a **double core XTensa LX7,** capable of running up to **240MHz**. In addition, it integrates **2.4GHz** connectivity with support for **WiFi** and **Bluetooth LE**. 

In the following image you can see the **functional diagram of the ESP32-S3** with all the peripherals it incorporates:

</Frame>

In addition to its power and versatility, we have integrated it into the kode dot expanding its capabilities with **32MB of flash** and **8MB of PSRAM.** Thus, it makes honor to its status as the **best maker device on the market** and executing programs much larger and more complex.

| Feature    | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Flash | External memory of **32MB by Octalbus** |
| PSRAM | Internal memory of **8MB by Octalbus** |

## Antenna
Inside the kode dot we have integrated a **2.4GHz antenna** in the PCB. With this antenna you will be able to use the **WiFi** and **Bluetooth LE** of the ESP32-S3, as well as **ESP-NOW** and other communication protocols that work in this frequency band.

## Programming
**Programming the kode dot is done like any other ESP32-S3-based board.** Connect it directly to your computer using the USB-C cable and start uploading your code.

<Note>In the [Applications](/en/kodeOS/apps) section it is explained in detail how to upload code and create applications.</Note>

Internally, the **USB-C data lines** are connected to the **GPIO19 and GPIO20** pins to use the internal USB-Serial peripheral.

With the USB-C, you also have the option to use the internal **USB Serial/JTAG** peripheral that the ESP32-S3 incorporates to **flash and debug the kode dot.**

For the most advanced, you can use the **GPIO39, GPIO40, GPIO41 and GPIO42** pins of the **top connector of the kode dot** to debug a program using an **external JTAG interface.**

## State control
The control of the **BOOT** and **RESET** states of the ESP32-S3 is performed using simple combinations with the **buttons of the kode dot.**

### RESET
To reset the kode dot, you must press the **left button of the pad** at the same time as you press the **bottom button.** This is useful in these cases: 

- When a program has been **flashed** and the kode dot is **locked.**
- To **exit an application** and return to the main menu.

### BOOT
To enter the kode dot in BOOT mode, while holding the **top button,** the kode dot must be reset following the RESET combination.

<Info>It is likely that you will not have to use this process since if the code you upload to the kode dot blocks or makes the ESP32-S3 restart, the kode dot will return to the main menu automatically.</Info>

## Example code
With this code you can get the **MAC address** of the different interfaces of the ESP32-S3.

```cpp esp32s3_info.ino lines icon="microchip"
/**
 * Displays ESP32-S3 microcontroller information via serial port.
 * Includes model, revision, number of cores, and Chip ID.
 * Prints the data every 3 seconds.
 */
/* ───────── KODE | docs.kode.diy ───────── */

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200); /* Starts serial communication at 115200 baud */
}

void loop() {
  /* Prints ESP32 chip model and revision */
  Serial.printf("ESP32 Chip model = %s Rev %d\n", ESP.getChipModel(), ESP.getChipRevision());
  
  /* Prints the number of cores in the chip */
  Serial.printf("This chip has %d cores\n", ESP.getChipCores());
  
  /* Prints the chip's unique identifier */
  Serial.print("Chip ID: "); 
  Serial.println(ESP.getEfuseMac()); 

  /* Waits 3 seconds before repeating */
  delay(3000); 
}
```
