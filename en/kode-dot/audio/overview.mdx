# What is the I2S bus
**Inter-IC Sound (I2S)** is a digital communication protocol designed specifically to **transmit audio between electronic devices.**

Unlike other buses like I2C, which are used to transmit general data between chips, I2S is **optimized to send audio data of high quality in real time.**

## How does I2S work?
The I2S bus uses several lines to transmit the information:
- **Serial Data (SD):** Where the audio data travels.
- **Serial Clock (SCK):** Marks the rhythm at which the bits are sent.
- **Word Select (WS):** Indicates if the data corresponds to the left or right channel (in stereo audio).

The **SCK and WS lines are common** to all devices that are connected to the I2S bus. However, both the speaker and the microphone have their **own SD lines.**

This structure allows the audio to be transmitted in a **synchronized and lossless manner, ideal for applications where sound quality is important.**

## Why use I2S for digital audio?

- **Quality:** Allows digital audio transmission without interference or typical noise of analog signals.
- **Synchronization:** Ensures that the data arrives at the right time, avoiding phase shifts or distortions.
- **Compatibility:** It is the standard in most modern audio chips, facilitating the integration of microphones and digital speakers.

In the kode dot, both the **microphone and the speaker are connected via I2S,** which allows recording and reproducing sound with great fidelity and efficiency.
